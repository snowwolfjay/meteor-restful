# meteor-restful
meteor restful api wrapper for methods

## almost like express for get/put/delete/post methods.

## spec1: server

### res.link -> add a url current request can continue do
> Example , if a user add a doc, you need add a link to query its info 
> If allow him delete this doc, add a delete link
> rel is a function name, dif request to same route may get different url for same action - based on role or sequence version and so on

## spec2: client
### api.useLink -
> get link base on rel name or "default" -
> run it with payload

## spec3ï¼šclient
### api.sequence -  run a serial request, first path is a real url - after it should be the rel name 
> example -> api.sequence('/users','create','phonecode')
>  will request '/users' then use the create rel then phonecode,
>> why?  when request '/users' if, this request has no auth or some case , no create ref return, blocked it and hide the real url - dynamic or some thing, or even link to anothor server


### with this, hope not use plugin at route for bussiness things, otherwise, god knowns what happened when request come up to this handle, so remove global plugin.

### but route("").use(plugin) still work at spec case or export it for other import , this left the import info to track what happened, other then search use("/")-use("/users")....

### and you can combine plugin togeter , and export const LoginAndRoleChecker = [LoginCheck,RoleCheck]

Have fun with restful and links - link's the natural hint and the reason internet boost -- so Just Favor it
